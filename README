The viewshed algorithm computes a grid of 0's and 1's representing whether that point is visible or not-visible from a specified point in a DEM.

Total viewshed algorithm computes the viewshed of every point in the grid.  The number of visible points is summed and put into an output grid at that point.

We use open MPI in order to parallelize the computations to speed up the algorithm.  Open MPI download can be found at http://www.open-mpi.org/.

Running the program:

1.  Use the Makefile to compile the code (NOTE: you will have to change the compiler in the make file to the path of "mpic++" on your machine).  

2.  Execute the program using the folloing syntax <path to openMPI>/mpirun -np 10 totalViewshed sampleDEM.asc outputDEM.asc
